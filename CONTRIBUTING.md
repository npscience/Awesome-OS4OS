Are you an open source tool builder looking to connect with new communities? 

** We are seeking contributions from people in a wide variety of fields - if you are new to GitHub, we will show you how to suggest a project **

Eligible projects
  1. Are *open source*
  2. Have a *code of conduct*
  3. Are things *you use*!
  
If you're ready to go: To suggest a project, please [create an issue](https://github.com/os4os/Awesome-OS4OS/issues) or [edit here](https://github.com/os4os/Awesome-OS4OS/blob/master/Awesome-OS4OS.md) and send a pull request!

If you want to know more: Below, we will define *open source*, and show *code of conduct* examples. 


### Definitions:
Open Source: [Open Source software has source code that is open for the public to inspect, modify, and enhance](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source). If you're not sure if the sofware you use is open source, check to see if they have a GitHub page, search for how they [license their software](https://opensource.org/licenses), ask them, or ask us!

Code of Conduct
Open Science: Open science means different things to different people. It’s an umbrella term that encompass a bunch of other ideas, research practices, and movements. To me, advocating for open science practices working to increase the transparency of science and people’s access to science.

Under the umbrella: Open science includes using open source software or other tools that make research more transparent and reproducible. It includes creating inclusive environments and working to address equity and inclusion in the profession of science. Open science means sharing your work in a way where it can reach people, including sharing preprints of publications, posting data to data repositories, and sharing code (example of code and data shared together here).  Citizen science — when research is conducted with the participation of the public — is open science. Engaging in public communication about science and the creation of open educational resources can empower the public with a better understanding of what we do, and can begin to address equity and inclusion when diverse audiences are on consulted and considered. Open science encourages publishing in journals that are freely accessible to all, so anyone can read your work. Open access publishing enables access to knowledge and helps to dismantle the systemic gate-keeping has that has  disenfranchised scholars from communities and regions of the world, for too long.
