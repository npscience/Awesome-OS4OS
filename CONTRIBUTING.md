Are you a researcher or scholar in any field who uses software to do your work?
Are you an open source tool builder looking to connect with new communities? 

We are seeking contributions from people in a wide variety of fields - if you are new to GitHub, we will show you how to suggest a project

Eligible projects
  1. Are *open source*
  2. Have a *code of conduct*
  3. Are things *you use*!
  
If you're ready to go: To suggest a project, please [create an issue](https://github.com/os4os/Awesome-OS4OS/issues) or [edit here](https://github.com/os4os/Awesome-OS4OS/blob/master/Awesome-OS4OS.md) and send a pull request!

If you want to know more: Below, we will discuss Issues and define terms. 

### Issues: GitHub has them and so can you
Although GitHub calls them issues, we'd like you to think of them as conversation starters. They're our way of communicating about what we can change and make better on a project. You might make an issue to suggest a new lisiting on the Awesome OS4OS list, to ask a question about the list, or a myriad of other questions/suggestions/thoughts. This is an informal way of communicating, so don't feel like your idea or question needs to be perfectly asked or completely researched before you make the issue. Importantly, the people who will respond to the issues are all really nice and interested in your ideas!

GitHub has a nice set of help pages if you're looking for more information about how to make an [issues](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).


### Definitions:
**Open Source:** [Open Source software has source code that is open for the public to inspect, modify, and enhance](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source). If you're not sure if the sofware you use is open source, check to see if they have a GitHub page, search for how they [license their software](https://opensource.org/licenses), ask them, or ask us!

**Code of Conduct:** A code of conduct helps to keep a community healthy. See examples at [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/), [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org/about/code-of-conduct/), and get started writing one for your project with [Mozilla Science's Getting Started with Codes of Conduct resource](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/code_of_conduct/).

**Open Science:** Open science means different things to different people. It’s an umbrella term that encompass a bunch of other ideas, research practices, and movements. Avocating for open science practices means working to increase the transparency of science and people’s access to science.
